# Introduction
This project explores how body weight is probabilistically influenced by calorie intake, water consumption, and gender. Drawing data from university students, it applies multiple linear regression to estimate the likelihood and strength of each factor’s contribution to overall weight variations.

# Explanation
The model accounts for roughly 76% of the observed weight differences. Calorie intake shows the strongest impact—every additional calorie increases weight by approximately 0.009 kg. Water intake also shows a positive influence, adding about 0.004 kg per milliliter. Gender is a significant categorical predictor, with males weighing around 6.3 kg more than females on average. The model’s p-value (< 0.001) indicates strong statistical significance, validating the observed relationships. The seemingly unusual water-weight relationship likely arises from body size variations or temporary fluid retention.
